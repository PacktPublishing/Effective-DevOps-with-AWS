## About the Book
The DevOps movement has transformed the way modern tech companies work. AWS which has been on the forefront of the Cloud computing revolution has also been a key contributor of this DevOps movement creating a huge range of managed services that help you implement the DevOps principles.

In this book, you’ll see how the most successful tech start-ups launch and scale their services on AWS and how you can too. Written by a lead member of Mediums DevOps team, this book explains how to treat infrastructure as code, meaning you can bring resources online and offline as necessary with the code as easily as you control your software. You will also build a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline to keep your app up to date. You’ll find out how to scale your applications to offer maximum performance to users anywhere in the world, even when traffic spikes with the latest technologies, such as containers and serverless computing. You will also take a deep dive into monitoring and alerting to make sure your users have the best experience when using your service.

Finally, you’ll get to grips with ensuring the security of your platform and data.
